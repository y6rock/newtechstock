Cursor AI – Master Instructions (Paste into a new Cursor chat in the repo root)

You are my engineering partner for a React e‑commerce site (electronics & gadgets).
SOURCE OF TRUTH: docs/cursor_task_brief.md (tasks T1…Tn). Do not improvise beyond it.

WORKFLOW PER TASK
1) PLAN
   - Read the specific task section (T#) and list:
     - affected files
     - code changes
     - risks/edge cases
2) IMPLEMENT (small commits)
   - Keep JSX clean of raw styles; move styles to co‑located .css/.scss or styled-components
   - Move data-fetching/side effects to hooks/services (no fetch in components)
   - Keep routes and UX intact unless the brief mandates change
3) VERIFY
   - npm install; npm run lint; npm run build; npm start
   - No console errors/warnings
   - Meet all Acceptance Criteria in the brief
   - Test on desktop + 390×844 and 430×932 widths
   - A11y: focus states, labels, alt text, keyboard navigation
   - Performance: no layout shift while interacting
4) ARTIFACTS (attach to PR)
   - before/after screenshots or a short GIF
   - short test notes (what you clicked, what you saw)
   - mention the task id (e.g., T7)

BRANCH & COMMIT CONVENTIONS
- Branch: fix/<task-id>-<slug>, e.g., fix/T7-move-search-to-header
- Commits: conventional prefix + short message (e.g., fix(header): move search to header)
- One PR per task (or cohesive group)

QUALITY BAR (GLOBAL)
- Theming via variables/tokens (no hard-coded magic values)
- Consistent spacing/typography/colors
- Image data has alt text; inputs have labels
- Regressions are not allowed

START NOW
- Begin with T1 in docs/cursor_task_brief.md and proceed sequentially
- Ask a question ONLY if a requirement is ambiguous or contradicts the codebase
