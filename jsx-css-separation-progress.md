## Summary:
- **Total files needing separation**: 9 files
- **Files already separated**: 25 files
- **Progress**: 25/34 (74% complete)

## Notes:
- Some files already have CSS files but still contain inline styles that need to be moved
- Priority should be given to components with extensive inline styles like NotificationModal.jsx
- Each file should have its styles moved to a corresponding .css file with the same name
